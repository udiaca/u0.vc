Hip hop

I like this album but not enough to markdown jam throughout each track.

clean, good representation of the current aesthetic

safe vibe songs
- easy to remix out/clip (e.g. end of *BelgraveRoad_1*)

it's about that money and good sex lifestyle

less a cohesive album and more a collection of singles
