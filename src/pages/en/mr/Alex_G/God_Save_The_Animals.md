I really love this album. I listened to it once and then listened to it again with this markdown file open. This is the first album I have ever markdown-jammed with.
That is how much I love this album.

The transitions in between tracks are so perfect.
Some tracks have this dramatic shift during the song between the 2/3rd mark (scream, melody/rhythm change) that make the album very interesting to listen as a whole.
The artist takes great care to guide you through the stories in each song and you leave feeling more energized and compassionate.

The songs are best enjoyed as part of the album. Individually, they still work but are not as thematic with the religious themes/album arc.

# Tracks

## After All

melancholy, mood, soft

> after all things may come and things may go away
> yeah but **God** with me he stayed

great opening song, really sets a lovely tone for the entire album.

## Runner

uplifting, boost, jogging song, mischief

> my runner my runner my man

amazing how they just throw in that bit of crazy!
really caught me by surprise at first
the creativity in verse 3 was not lost on me. 

## Mission

steady, slower, maintain the energy

> ain't gonna right your wrong
> with a stupid love song

sounds like someone justifying their life- maybe an irreconcilable difference?

## S.D.O.S

the trip kicks in, album drop, stern vibes with uplifting ending

> naked in my innocence
> tangled in my innocence

discovering that you are being seen by god always.
good to listen to in the shower

## No Bitterness

kindness, recall the innocence, recall that is you

> My teacher is a child with a big smile, no bitterness

don't be so hard on yourself- you're good
gotta answer the big questions and not dwell on your mistakes

## Ain't It Easy

feeling safe, being welcomed back home

> No more judges, no more medicine
> When I talk to you, I take you in

after you're done with the drugs, you know we'll still love you
we're here for you, and we have boundless love for you

## Cross the Sea

steady, then shock!

> cross the sea yeah yeah yeah yeah

you're sailing across the ocean and you hit some turbulence and get messed up

## Blessing

dirty synth, boots and cats, L-R audio play, very understandable vocals

> every day 
> Is a blessing
> As I walk
> Through the mud

now you're messed up son
and that cut-off!!

## Early Morning Waiting

chipper, energy slowly rises

> Early morning waiting

kinda feels like getting out of bed on a good day
but still having anxious thoughts
like you're still suffering, but at least the morning is good, idk

## Immunity

starts off with nice yeah, yeah (ahhh! wooooo! oooooooh!)

> I have to put the cocaine in the vaccine
> Walk out of the doctor with immunity

oh shit, did I relapse again? but I'm immune dawg
here we go again

`the dissonance`

reality seems to be coming apart a bit

## Headroom Piano

base, beat, bop

> I just want to be free
> That's all I want

bad part of the trip, you just want to be free
but you're stuck with you
then it becomes the good end of the trip by the end of the song

how does it do that?

## Miracles

ballad, optimistic, folk, violin

> I see great waves coming our way
> Beautiful sunsets on lost and lonely days
> Infinite futures become a single past
> Everyone whimpers, nobody lasts

you love someone so much that you're going to have a child with them even though you're troubled
then, religion?
wonder what people find when they discover religion
is it really better than all the drugs?

## Forgive

familiar, increasing gain

> Forgive yesterday, ooh-hoo
> I choose today, yeah, yeah, yeah

we're at the end of the trip boys
just remember that we're all just cosmic dust floating in the wind
and that we need to be kind and love each other
and that there's no time like the now

like the now

[now](/now)
