    I could tell that you had some anxiety- especially when you said "god" so many times after I booked that order :)

    Where do you think anxiety comes from?

    I like to think of anxiety as a necessary thing that you cannot remove.
    A little bit of anxiety enables us to do a good job, and it shows that we really care!
