[I am UDIA, the identity.](/)

I am an `attention` idle game.

## More Technical

I am a website running on the [Astro web framework](https://astro.build/).

Interactive JavaScript UI components use the [Svelte framework](https://svelte.dev/).

I am hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

I am [authored by Alex][alex].

My domain name was purchased by [Alex][alex] through [Gandi.net](https://www.gandi.net).

I am using the GDPR friendly analytics tool/SaaS offering [Plausible](https://plausible.io).

- [See the full website statistics here!](/analytics)
- [We apply a proxy through CloudFlare Workers](https://plausible.io/docs/proxy/guides/cloudflare).

## Less Technical

I want this website to be an interactive and helpful tool to the traveling [netizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netizen).

This website should also be [entertaining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment) (like [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/)) and yet [respectful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respect) of people's [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time).

If you are interested in following along, or getting notified whenever something changes, feel free to `star` or `watch` [this repository on GitHub](https://github.com/udiaca/u0.vc).

I aim to be as transparent as possible throughout the [creative process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqwEfZm9-nw).
