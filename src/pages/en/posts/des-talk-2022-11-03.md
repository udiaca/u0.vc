# Meta

[Volunteered to give a talk within DES. `Getting Started with Astro Framework and Cloudflare Pages`](https://devedmonton.slack.com/archives/CCJKEG01F/p1666414243497579?thread_ts=1666373467.169529&cid=CCJKEG01F).

- In this quick talk, we will spin up a quick Cloudflare Pages application running the [Astro web framework](https://astro.build/) with client side [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) from scratch!

# Talk Structure

- What is Astro?

  - All-in-one web framework for building [Multi-Page Applications (MPA)](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/mpa-vs-spa/#terminology)
  - [`1.5.2` released October 19, 2022](https://github.com/withastro/astro/releases/tag/astro%401.5.2)
  - [`1.0.0` released August 9, 2022](https://github.com/withastro/astro/releases/tag/astro%401.0.0)

- Defaults to a static site generator

  - Allows you to write content using markdown and routes based on the file system
  - Can be configured to handle [full server-side rendering](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/server-side-rendering/), generating pages at request time
  - This talk will also go through an example of this using [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)

- Allows serving multiple front-end UI frameworks within the same web application, using [Islands web architecture pattern](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/)

  - This talk will go through setting up the [@astrojs/svelte](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/svelte/) integration

- Demo

```bash
npm create astro@latest
# des-talk-2022-11-03, empty project, relaxed typescript
npm run dev
```

- Deploy to CF Pages (push to Github, within CF setup a pages integration)
