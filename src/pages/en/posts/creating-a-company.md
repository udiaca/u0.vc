I am once again interested in starting a [company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company).

To facilitate this, I am using the [RBC Ventures Inc.](https://www.rbcventures.ca) owned service, [Ownr](https://www.ownr.co).

- [Please use this link or the following coupon code to get a $30.00 credit for your account.](https://www.ownr.co/new?coupon=RC-N3WVX927R8)
- `RC-N3WVX927R8`

The corporate entity that I choose was the [Sole Proprietor](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed-income/setting-your-business/sole-proprietorship.html).

- This entity will be owned by one individual (myself) and I assume all risks of this business.

The business registration was completed on `October 18, 2022`.
