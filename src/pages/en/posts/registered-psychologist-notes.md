# Second session with Doris.

Nov 9, 2022. 12-1pm.

- Try to find the middle ground of 'helplessness'.
    - Far negative spectrum:
        - learned helplessness
        - "I give up attitude"
        - show no effort to do well
    - Far positive spectrum:
        - competence
        - understanding that the locus of control is within one's self
- An analogy to 'arrogance'
    - Far negative spectrum:
        - self deprecating / self defecating
        - meek / overtly humble
    - Far positive spectrum:
        - superiority complex

- Why do I want to build my app but I don't make meaningful progress on it?
    - Possible that the tasks are too large/vague?
    - Doris suggested that I seek a technological mentor

- I want the app to feel like there is a benevolent 'someone' living inside of your head.
    - I would use that.
